# Creating-a-Scatter-Chart-Using-CO2-Emission-for-fossil-fuels-in-2022.
This sample demonstrates how to create a Scatter Chart in .NET MAUI [SfCartesianChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/getting-started) Using CO2 Emission for fossil fuels in 2022.

## Scatter Chart
The scatter chart is used to represent the each data point by a dot or circle with equal size. To render a scatter chart, create an instance of ScatterSeries, and add it to the Series collection property of SfCartesianChart. The segment size can be defined by using the PointHeight and PointWidth properties.

## Customizing the scatter plot
We can customize the scatter point height and width using PointHeight and PointWidth properties respectively, customize the scatter color and border of the scatter using Fill and Stroke properties respectively.

We can display the information about CO2 emission and fossil fuel consumption per captia by enabling the tooltip using EnableTooltip property and customize the appearance of the tooltip using TooltipTemplate property.

## Selection Zooming interactive feature
We choose to focus on a specific area of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption and zoom in based on our viewing perspective by enabling the EnableSelectionZooming property in the ZoomPanBehavior.
